Outside Source:
    Apart from referencing previous labs, I used chatGPT to assist with the implementation of the pantry.h file because that part was a little confusing to me.


Summary:
What went well:
    - Creating the main function was straightforward
    - Putting my thoughts into code came a lot more naturally than it did a few weeks ago
    - Thinking of an idea to code
    - Creating the pantry_Item class was pretty straightforward as well

What was challenging:
    - Implementing the pantry.h file was tough
    - Understanding the signifance and creation of the pantry.h file was difficult


Overall there's clear progress in my understanding of C++, but I still have some more to learn!
